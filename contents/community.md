# Building Community


Project success also depends on a solid and engaged community. So let's dive deep into the Unite DAO Community-Building Strategy to understand how we will build.


## Goals:

- Build a solid and engaged community.
- Create and maintain community channels: Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Youtube.
- Create Content Strategies for the different channels.


## Key questions:

- *What macro content will we create?*
- *On what channels will we create it?*
- *How will we repurpose Macro-content into Micro?*
- *How will we distribute that Micro-content?*
- *How will we listen to our audience?*
- *How will we measure our KPI’s?*


## Macro-content:

- Youtube

Our focus will be on the Youtube channel. This will be our main Macro-content channel. The first 6 episodes will be with Alex Puig (Alex) and Arturas Salnikovas (Art). Later we will invite other team members from different departments to speak and share experiences. After that, we will start with Guests - there will be a schedule of invitations with crypto projects and entrepreneurs.

## Micro-content:

- Social media posts

We have prepared the main social media platforms for our content distribution. We will make a long-form video for Youtube first, then - we will distribute this video in short chunks across all our social media channels: Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Medium, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Substack.


# Content strategy:

1. **Inspiration** — Problems and questions people ask in our niche. 
We also can look at our socials and get inspiration for content. 

2. **Keywords** — Main keywords. 
E.g., Web3 Standards, NFT gaming, Interoperability, DAO. 
Keywords will be the central axis where we will create our content around. 

3. **Keyword Research** — Use Google and Youtube auto-complete functions to find keywords.

4. **Develop Content Ideas** — Three main categories of content:
 - *Motivational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*
 - *Educational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*
 - *Actionable content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*

`3 categories of content X 5 keywords X 10 ideas each = 150 content/month`

5. **Create amazing content** — Start content production,produce anything that adds value to the viewer/reader.

 Make sure 3 things are right:
- Titles
- Keywords
- Links

6. **Content Marketing** — Start promoting the content:
- Organic — All our social network channels. 
- Paid — Facebook and LinkedIn ads.

## Re-Use the Content (Micro-content):

- Break the Youtube videos into chunks/sections.
- Optimize the copy. Turn chunks/sections into social media posts.
- Short paragraphs - hook the reader.
- Make it scannable/readable.
- Create graphics/pictures for the posts.


## Post Formula:

1. (Headline)
2. Hook
3. Pain Points
4. Solution
5. CTA


## Content Calendar and Tools:

- Create a content calendar. We use Sprout Social to schedule all posts.
- No more than 30 days upfront.
- Always leave some space for new ideas and breaking news.
